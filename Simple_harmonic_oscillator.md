## Overview
Using the already solved time independent Schr√∂dinger equation for simple harmonic oscillator using box basis on domain [- a, a] in dimensionless units. In order to simplify the problem, I decide a to use a piecewise linear function to approximate the our harmonic oscillator
I wrote down the problem in dimensionless units and solved it using box basis functions and calculated the Eigen values and states. I also plotted the Eigen values as a function of n and compared the plot with the harmonic oscillator Eigen values plot.
How good is this approximation? I would say the approximation works pretty good at low value of N but not too well at high value of N.
