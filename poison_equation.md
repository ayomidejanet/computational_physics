## Overview
Consider Poison equation on two dimensional domain given by Cmin= (-1, - 1) and
max = (1,1) in nanometer.
I calculate the electrostatic potential due to a circular ring like arrangement of charges at the center of the domain of radius 0.5 nm, with potential going to zero on all the boundaries of the domain, using the finite difference Poisson2D code discussed in the class. I assumed that a charge density of positive one electronic charge is placed in each grid cell on the ring.
I also showed the surface plot of such potential and discuss the quality and stability of my solution as a function of the number of grid points used.
